* Things to do

  Re-think the verbosity levels. Level 3 is the first one that includes command lines, but is far too
  verbose for normal usage. There should probably be a new one here that includes warnings and compile
  commands.

  Make sure we process all input from a process that has died. Currently, if a process prints
  lots of things to stdout and then crashes, sometimes we do not get all of it through mymake.
  This may be either because mymake exits, or because mymake decides the process is dead and do
  not need more output.
  
  Move constants used with Config into string constants somewhere.

  Ignore comments in the include parser.
