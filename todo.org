* Things to do

  Make sure we process all input from a process that has died. Currently, if a process prints
  lots of things to stdout and then crashes, sometimes we do not get all of it through mymake.
  This may be either because mymake exits, or because mymake decides the process is dead and do
  not need more output.
  
  Move constants used with Config into string constants somewhere.

  Ignore comments in the include parser.
