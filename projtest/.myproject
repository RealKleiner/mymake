#Mymake project file.

#Each sub-directory contains a target, this file specifies any dependencies
#between these projects, aside from what mymake can infer automatically.

#Mymake tries to link any library projects automatically, but this might need
#to be specified explicitly in each target.

#This file can contain many of the regular options in mymake, and these are
#applied to each of the targets (targets may override these settings).


#include the project directory as well.
include+=../

#How to build each target.
[build]

#options when building lib.
io+=lib

#options when building main (none needed)
#main


#Depencies
[deps]

#Explicit dependency on lib. This is not needed, as mymake can figure it out.
#main+=io
