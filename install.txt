How to install mymake:

-Build the executable using make.

cd into the cloned directory and run "make". This will produce the executable
mymake.


-Add an alias.

Adding an alias makes it possible to use mymake as if mymake was in the PATH, 
even when it is not.

Open the .rc file for your shell and add an alias.

~/.cshrc.private:
alias mm "~/path/to/mymake"

~/.bashrc
alias mm="~/path/to/mymake"


-Setup the default .mymake.

mymake will check for settings in three places when it is run. First it will
parse ~/.mymake (if it exists). Then the .mymake in the current directory
will be parsed (if it exists), and last any command line parameters will
be parsed. Settings overwrites each other, so the settings found in ~/.mymake
have the lowest priority and the settings on the command-line have the highest
priority.
To make it easy to change global settings with mymake, it is recommended
to create a .mymake file in ~. This is done by executing "mymake -config".
The generated file will also contain comments to further document the settings.

It is recommended to change the compilation command to include more flags
of your choice.


-Use mymake.

See help.txt for further instructions on usage.
